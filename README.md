# Java-Swing-Project

Hi, So this is project which utilizes the concepts of Java Swing and its functionalities like J-Frame, MDI Application and a MySQL Database for data storage.
The main working of this application is basically a Login/Registration format for a Database called WebApp.
It works with the user creating a new Registration (if they are new) on a swing internal fram form and the details are saved on the database.
If the user is a registered one then he/she/they can stright away login with their unique detail i.e. email and password they had set.
There are many small checking procedures which are implemented making sure that the correct info is added to which if correct then a new form with the Details stored of the user are displayed.
